# Vigenere Cipher Extended

This is a extended implementation of the basic vigenere cipher that uses additional ASCII values from 32 to 126 instead of the basic 25 alphabet letters. 

## Info

This repo contains 2 implementations of the cipher, a basic cpp file and an object oriented programming approach. This cipher was implemented because I needed a basic cipher to use in another project. 
The object oriented implementetion was just so I could refresh my basic c++ oop knowledge. To run the project use the cmd and type make then .\cipher.exe

## Algorithm

All the credits for the used algorithm goes to this paper.
